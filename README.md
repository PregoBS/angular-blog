# Angular Blog - Projects Portfolio

see [pregobs.xyz](http://www.pregobs.xyz) in production

Project made as a challenge of the Bootcamp Java + Angular | DIO

I decided to use this project as a portfolio to show the projects I worked on and tell about my evolution as a programmer.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
